Welcome to the scenic islands of pelagium!

In order to win a scenario, you have to capture the majority of its settlements.
Settlements under your party's control allow you to train new units.

There are three different types of units: infantry, cavalry, and artillery.
Each unit type has its particular strengths and weaknesses.

By tapping or clicking on one of your units, you can see its properties and field of movement.
Tapping or clicking on a tile within the field of movement makes the unit move thereto.
When you are done with giving orders, press the button "next turn".

As soon as all players have given their orders, the turn will be evaluated.
Units move round-robin in the same sequence as they were given orders.
If a unit enters a tile already occupied by another party's unit, a battle ensues.

Nearby units of the same party may support their comrades.
Also the terrain has a significant effect on the battle's outcome.
The engagement ends with one unit involved either surrendering or retreating.

Thus key for success is distributing forces in a way that they optimally support each other and ultimately serve your strategic goals.
OK, enough with theory, let's gain some real experience!
